You can see the website of my project [here]([https://hilalsay.github.io/cs210-project/](https://zeynepkasabali.wixsite.com/my-site-1)). I designed this website for my CS210 course to observe my viewing habits using my Netflix data.

## Hypothesis
There is a significant decrease in my Netflix viewing time during the corona period and my viewing time after starting university.

## Motivation
The motivation behind starting the project to analyze my Netflix viewing habits is deeply rooted in my quest for self-awareness and the desire to gain valuable insight into my entertainment preferences. By examining the data covering my viewing history, I examined how my Netflix viewing time changed during and after the Corona period, and then I aimed to find out in which time periods and days I watched Netflix and which content I watched more. This project provides a platform to learn about my entertainment preferences by applying my data analytics skills. This project results in a meaningful and engaging analysis of my Netflix viewing journey.

## Data Source
I downloaded my detailed viewer histories from Netflix by requesting my data source through my own Netflix account. Since my Netflix account was a joint family account, it contained the viewer information of everyone who used it. That's why I filtered the data only for the part containing my personal information. Afterwards, I cleared the columns that I would not use for analysis. I made a process to convert the duration time information to Turkey time and classified the content I watched as movies and TV series. I also categorized the content I watched to see what days and times of the week I watched it. As you can see some of the data I edited on the right, it contains: Start Time, Profile Name, Duration, Title, Device Type, Bookmark, Latest Bookmark, Country, weekday, hour, and Type information for each watched content. 

## Data Analysis
Through data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and the application of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, I delved into the nuances of my viewing patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear regression allowed me to quantify the impact of these periods on my viewing times, while cluster analysis aimed to unveil distinct patterns in my habits. Exploring ANOVA and visualization techniques like boxplots enriched my analysis, providing insights into the cyclical nature of my viewing behavior. Additionally, I addressed practical aspects, such as finding the top 10 movies and TV series, and calculating total viewing times for each category separately. Overall, this project served as a personalized journey into data analytics, offering a unique lens through which to explore my own entertainment preferences and habits.

## Findings
1. Changes in Viewing Habits: I observed shifts in your viewing habits during the pandemic compared to the after-pandemic period. This includes variations in the duration, frequency and timeline
2. Impact of the Pandemic: The analysis highlighted the impact of the pandemic on my entertainment choices. I realized from the amount of time I spent watching Netflix how my time on digital platforms increased due to social distance restrictions due to the pandemic.
3. Temporal Patterns: I uncovered temporal patterns in my viewing behaviors. I have identified certain days or times when I tend to watch more. I learned that I prefer to watch Netflix more on weekends and late nights.
4. Favorite Genres or Titles: I identified my favorite types of content by discovering the most popular TV series and movies that I spend time on. I also discovered content that I watched over and over again and learned that I preferred TV series over movies.
5. Statistical Significance: Using statistical techniques such as ANOVA and linear regression helped me analyze changes in my viewing times between two periods. I learned how these techniques are applied when testing hypotheses.

## Limitations & Future Work
1. Fine-Grained Genre Analysis: I want to break down my analysis by specific genres and identify my most-watched genres during different periods, and explore trends within each genre.
2. Content Recommendation System: I want to use machine learning techniques to build a personalized content recommendation system based on my viewing history. This could involve collaborative filtering.
3. Rating Analysis: I also want to analyze my data according to the ratings of movies and TV series. This way, I can find out whether I'm watching my generally liked content. My current data is a little incomplete in this respect.
